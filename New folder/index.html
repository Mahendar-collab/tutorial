    <p>Explore where these cricket legends come from.</p>
    <div id="interactive-map"> <p>   MS Dhoni currently lives in his Ranchi farmhouse, along with his wife Sakshi, and daughter Ziva. This farmhouse in Ranchi, named Kailashpati by the former skipper, is reportedly just a twenty-minute drive from his first home. The massive property, located at Ranchi’s Ring Road, boasts everything fancy and grand, catering to the ex-Indian cricket team captain’s personality.
        The property was built over three years and has an ultra-modern gym, net practicing field, swimming pool, indoor stadium, and even a 5-star hotel. Most of it is covered in landscaped lawns and various types of trees, something Dhoni adores. The farmhouse also has an independent complex that has glass walls, which houses the former captain’s most prized possessions - his enviable collection of cars and bikes.</p>
    
       <p> The super talented Virat Kohli, the captain of India’s Cricket team, is the owner of one of the luxurious houses in India. Kohli bought this lavish house in 2016, for a whopping amount of 34 Crore. Virat’s new home is in the C-Wing on the 35th floor of the Omkar ‘1973’, a 4.5-acre project in Worli, Mumbai.</p>

        <P>Tendulkar’s unusual house, built to resemble a shell, is located in Bandra, a suburb of Mumbai. The interiors of this beautifully designed shell house are just breathtaking. The house is shielded by high-walled fencing and is fully covered by CCTV cameras and a couple of sensors such as burglar alarms, fire alarms, etc.</p></div>
